# PR #208 — Create / Forgot Password: review notes

Scratchpad for findings to turn into GitHub review comments. Lives on the
overlay branch (never merged), alongside the design-overlay tooling.

PR: https://github.com/uwblueprint/food4kids/pull/208
Head at time of review: `cf8beabf`

## Findings

### 1. Resend cooldown is 60s; the design says 10s

`frontend/src/pages/auth/ForgotPassword.tsx` — `ResetLinkConfirmation` starts
`useState(60)` and resets to `60` after a resend, rendering
`Send again in {countdown} seconds`.

The Figma "Developer Notes" frame *Link send cooldown* (desktop section,
node `4438:35103`) says:

> After 10 seconds, the button will tick down from a 10 second timer until
> they can resend the link.

Confirm which is intended before commenting — 60s may be a deliberate
anti-abuse choice, but it does not match the spec as written.

### 2. Password-criteria copy — FIXED (code + Figma)

Designer confirmed the desktop wording wins. Mobile/tablet Figma said
"Password must be:" with five verbose bullets; desktop said "Password must
include:" with four. Code had the desktop bullets under the mobile heading.

- Code: heading → "Password must include:"; first bullet "(12 or more is
  recommended)" → "(12 or more is better)".
- Figma: "Driver | Create Password" reworded to the desktop copy on mobile
  (`4438:35155`) and tablet (`4438:35352`), and the separate lowercase bullet
  deleted so both list four items.

**Still open** — the four "Driver | Create Password Filled" frames (mobile
`4438:35194`, `4438:35214`; tablet `4438:35391`, `4438:35411`) are untouched.
They show uppercase satisfied while lowercase is not, which the merged
"One uppercase and one lowercase letter" bullet cannot express. Needs a call
from the designer on what those states should show before editing.

### 3. Create-password mobile graphic — FIXED (code)

`WrapperWithLogo` rendered the mobile illustration on every auth screen. The
designs drop it only on the password-entry forms (login, forgot password, and
the Account Created confirmation all keep it). Added
`showMobileIllustration` (default true); `CreatePassword` passes
`step === 'CONFIRMATION'` and `ResetPassword` passes `false`.

## Not yet raised — more design/code mismatches

- Mobile "Driver | Create Password" has an **Email** field above the password
  fields; the desktop frame and the implementation both omit it.
- Mobile "Forgot Password" subheader reads "Enter the email address your admin
  used to invite you. We'll send a link to reset your password."; the code
  uses "What email did your admin use to sign you up?".

## Verified as matching the design notes

- Password unhide is per-field, not both at once (`showPassword` and
  `showConfirmPassword` are separate) — matches the *Drivers Creating account*
  note.
- The forgot-password confirmation does not reveal whether the account exists
  ("If an account exists for that email…") — matches the *Creation Link Sent*
  note.

## Screens still to walk

Four routes, checked at mobile (375) / tablet (834) / desktop (1440):

- `/login` — default, filled, credential error, "Get your login link"
- `/forgot-password` — FORM, CONFIRMATION + countdown
- `/forgot-password/:token` — validating, invalid token, form, submit error
- `/create-password/:token` — bad UUID, FORM, CONFIRMATION

`CreatePasswordForm` is shared by the last two; its empty / criteria-not-met /
passwords-don't-match states need checking from both entry points.
